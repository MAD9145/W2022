# Visual Design Assignment

## Description

Based on your mid-fidelity wireframes, provide a visual design for your mobile app using the UX visual design principles. Use the UI design tool your are familiar with to apply visual treatment to the same screens as your wireframe, this time adding visual design to increase usability. Ensure your visual design document is organized for the interactive visual mockup tool: InVision or Adobe Xd or Sketch.

Submit visual design for: 
- 3 key screens (use the 3 from your midterm, unless you have reason to select different screens)
Submit in one PDF file (it will be a 3-page file)
You are being marked on how you apply the elements of design to achieve and demonstrate the principles of design.

Refer to Week 11-1 Lecture and this article.
