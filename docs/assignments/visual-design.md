# Visual Design Assignment

## Description

Add visual design to your mobile app using the UX visual design principles, based on your mid-fidelity wireframes. Use any familiar UI design tool to apply visual treatment to the same screens as your wireframes. Now, add visual design to **increase usability** and support brand consistency. 

Ensure that your visual design document is organized for the interactive visual mockup tool: InVision or Adobe Xd, or Sketch. 

Your submission will include a minimum of 3 key screens in ONE PDF file. We will check how well you applied the elements and principles of design to demonstrate and support both good usability and a brand strategy.
