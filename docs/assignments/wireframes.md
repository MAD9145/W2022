# Wireframes Assignment

## Description

You are now ready to convert your hand drawn paper prototype into a medium fidelity greyscale wireframe. Take this opportunity to improve on the application user interface and add detailed UI design to support good user experience. 

Submit the first set of UI screens that support the main usage scenario(s) for the primary persona.  Screens may include Home screen, browse screen, detail screen, and more. Include annotation to explain user flow where is necessary. Your app will involve more screens, and you will continue to work on the detailed UI design. Your assignment submission at this point requires the 3 key screens and the flow of 1 usage scenario. 

Make sure your wireframe document is organized for the interactive visual mockup tool: InVision or Adobe Xd or Sketch.

## Things to consider

1. Branding: does the client already have brand? Must your team use it?
2. Screen sizes: are you targeting one platform, or many? For example, just the iPad Retina or all products in the Samsung Galaxy series (i.e. phones and tablets)
3. Does your design comply with your chosen platform's design guidelines?
4. Information Architecture: what are the important things on the page? Are they in the right place?
5. Terminology: what labels are you using on buttons and in headings
6. Does your layout help users understand where to focus, where to go next, etc?
7. Did you use suitable controls for the type of information being captured?
8. Have you indicated which fields are mandatory, and which are optional?
9. Does your wireframe require any annotations to communicate the design to the person reading it?
