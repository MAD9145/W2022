# MAD9145 - Week 1

## Course Overview

There are four phases to the client applied project course.

1. Research & Planning <Badge text="30% of final grade" />
2. Design & Prototyping <Badge text="20% of final grade" />
3. Development & Testing <Badge text="20% of final grade" />
4. Finalizing & Client Hand-Off <Badge text="30% of final grade" />

The Phases are roughly equivalent to the four months in the Semester. See the Badge beside each phase name for the weighting of the assignments during that phase.

In the first phase we are trying to really get to the root of the problem that is needed to be solved for the client.

In the second phase we are designing the interface and optimizing what will become the user experience in the app.

The third phase is all about doing the development work of turning the designs and prototypes into a functioning app, while doing iterative development and testing. 

The final phase is about wrapping up the final development on the required features, working on a deployment plan, documentation, and handing the completed project off to the client.

## Team Identity

Your first deliverable is the [Team Identity](../assignments/identity.md) assignment. You should have a first draft of your logo completed for the status meeting during the first week. The final version of your logo and the team name are due for the start of the class in week two.

## Team Conduct Contract

We will discuss and agree on a late / absence penalty policy during the first class.

Each team will also need to come up with a code of behaviour that all team members agree to. This policy should cover things like responsibility for assignment submissions, communication with clients and each other, attendance at team meetings, attendance at team work sessions, turn around time for required work, and so on.

## Client Meeting

Every team should have a decent idea what their project is now but you need to have a full meeting with your client as soon as possible to really start to understand what you need to do. This meeting will lay the ground work for your research work during this first phase.

## Client Terms & Conditions

All the clients have signed off on the terms and conditions for the project. 

The biggest things to note are that:

At the end of the semester the client owns the intellectual property of the app;

The client pays no money for the work but they have agreed to give their time to work with your team;

You will be allowed to use the finished app as part of your portfolio;

We will not be putting the app on the App Store or Google Play, but the client may opt to hire one or more team members to do this or future work on the app after the semester ends;

Here is a copy of the [Terms & Conditions document](/mad9145-w19/terms-and-conditions-final-w19.pdf)


## Status Meetings

Each Thursday between 12pm and 3pm there will be team status meetings. These meetings will be held in the DARE District. Each team will have a 30 minute window for their meeting.

Some of these meetings will be where you submit deliverables. Some will give you an opportunity to ask questions that are specific to your team's project.

Attendance at these meetings is required for all team members.

We will randomly select the time slot for each team using this:
[Meeting Picker](https://prof3ssorst3v3.github.io/meeting-picker/)
We will run this in class.

## Software

While much of the software that you use will depend on your project, we will be using Wrike as the project management software.

The communication software that your team uses can be chosen by your team.

## Journey Mapping 
We will "_use story and its underlying structure to craft intended experiences of use that are optimized for audience engagement,_"
* Concept Story: Position your product, it’s big picture story, and what it means to your target audience
* Origin Story: How and why your character(s) will discover and use your product the first time
 ( ideate: marketing, sales, business development, and advertising intersect with product design and development)
* Usage Story: How your product works, how people use it, and how and why they will love using it(usage scenarios)
