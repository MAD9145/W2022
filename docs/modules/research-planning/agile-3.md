## Why the agile methodology is better

When you take the aggregate of agile principles, implement them in an agile framework, leverage collaboration tools, and adopt agile development practices, you usually get better-quality applications, faster-developed applications, and better technical methods (aka hygiene).

The core reason is that agile is designed for flexibility and adaptability. You don’t define all the answers up front as you do in the waterfall method, but break the problem into digestible components to develop and test with users. If something isn’t working well or as expected, or if the effort reveals something that hadn’t been considered, you can quickly adapt the attempt to get back on track quickly—or even change paths if that’s what’s needed. Agile lets each team member contribute to the solution, and it requires that each takes personal responsibility for his or her work.

Agile development is better for many problems because its principles, frameworks, and practices are designed around today’s operating conditions. Agile frameworks and development processes that prioritize delivering working software iteratively and promote leveraging feedback to improve the application and process is more suitable to today’s world of operating smarter and faster.

Agile development is also better because it encourages an ongoing process of improvement. Imagine if Microsoft ended Windows development after version 3.1 or Google stopped improving its search algorithms in 2002. Software is in constant need of being updated, supported, and enhanced; agile and iterative processes establish both a mindset and strategy for that continuous improvement.

Finally, agile development is better because people are more productive and happier working with this process. Engineers have a say in how much work they are taking on, and they are proud to show their results. Product owners like seeing their vision expressed in software sooner and changing prioritize based on the latest insights. Users like getting software that does what they need in a way that meets or enhances their processes.

## The benefits of agile

Agile was originally developed for the software industry to streamline and improve the development process in an effort to rapidly identify and adjust for issues and defects. It provides a way for developers and teams to deliver a better product, in a faster manner, through short, iterative, interactive sessions/sprints. In the era of digital transformation, with many companies migrating to a digital workplace, agile is a perfect fit for organizations looking to transform how they manage projects and operate as a whole. Agile can help ensure company-wide process and methodological alignment. In terms of business benefits, both the digital workplace and agile provide:

- Increased flexibility
- Increased productivity
- Increased transparency
- Higher quality deliverables
- Decreased risk of missed objectives
- Increased stakeholder engagement and satisfaction

## The future of agile

As competition is continually increasing and time to market is shrinking, agile offers numerous benefits and limited drawbacks. As more companies shift to a digital workplace that is highly dependent on speed, flexibility, and increased productivity, agile or hybrid methodologies will become increasingly necessary. Its application in multiple industries and alignment with the benefits offered by a digital workplace model indicate that agile adoption rates will continue to increase across industries around the world.
