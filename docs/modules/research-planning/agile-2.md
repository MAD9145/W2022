## Scrum, Kanban, and other agile frameworks

Many agile frameworks that provide specifics on development processes and agile development practices, aligned to a software development life cycle.

The most popular agile framework is called [scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum). It focuses on a delivery cadence called a sprint and meeting structures that include the following:

- Planning — where sprint priorities are identified
- Commitment — where the team reviews a list or backlog of user stories and decides how much work can be done in the sprint’s duration 
- Daily standup meetings — so teams can communicate updates on their development status and strategies)

Sprints end with a demo meeting where the functionality is shown to the product owner, followed by a retrospective meeting where the team discusses what went well and what needs improvement in their process.

Many organizations employ scrum masters or coaches to help teams manage the scrum process.

Although scrum dominates, there are other agile frameworks:

- Kanban works as a fan-in and fan-out process where the team pulls user stories from an intake board and funnels them through a staged development process until they are completed.
- Some organizations adopt a hybrid agile and waterfall approach, using agile processes for new applications and waterfall for legacy ones.
- There are also several frameworks to enable organizations to scale the practice to multiple teams.

While agile frameworks define process and collaboration, agile development practices are specific to addressing software development tasks performed in alignment with an agile framework.

So, for example:

- Some teams adopt pair programming, where two developers code together to drive higher quality code and to enable more senior developers to mentor junior ones.
- More advanced teams adopt test-driven development and automation to ensure the underlying functionality delivers the expected results.
- Many teams also adopt technical standards so that the developer’s interpretation of a user story doesn’t lead to just the functionality desired but also meets security, code quality, naming conventions, and other technical standards.
