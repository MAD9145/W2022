## Sample Meeting Agenda

When you are going to hold meetings with your clients, you should give them notice of the meeting at least three days prior. The agenda for the meeting should be sent to the client at least 24 hours before the meeting. This will give them a chance to review the agenda, propose changes, and prepare any required documents for the meeting.

When sending a notice about something or a request to a client, if it is something official, then you should send it in Memo format. Below are a couple sample documents that you can use.

Here is a [Sample Agenda document](/mad9145-w19/Meeting-Agenda.docx)

Here is a [Sample Memo document](/mad9145-w19/Memo-Example.pdf)

Meeting Minutes can also be created based on the Meeting Agenda document. Things that you want to record from each meeting include:

- Who was in attendance
- What was discussed (this comes from the agenda)
- What were the action items from the meeting (Who is doing what)


## Learning To Use Wrike

Your [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com) accounts will soon be live. You will be receiving invitations to join an account and you will be assigned to a project. The team lead and design lead will be set as the owners of the project but everyone on the team will be invited to participate in the project.

There is a free student version of Wrike, however, this is limited to 5 people on a team. 

We will be using a sponsored version of their system where everyone can be invited, including Su Cheng and Steve.
