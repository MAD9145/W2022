## Sample Meeting Agenda

When you are going to hold meetings with your clients, you should give them notice of the meeting at least three days prior. The agenda for the meeting should be sent to the client at least 24 hours before the meeting. This will give them a chance to review the agenda, propose changes, and prepare any required documents for the meeting.

When sending a notice about something or a request to a client, if it is something official, then you should send it in Memo format. Below are a couple sample documents that you can use.
